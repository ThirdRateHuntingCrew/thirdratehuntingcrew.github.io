            <h3>
                For this project, I was tasked with creating an entire database for a Pet Daycare.
                This involved creating many tables to cross-reference information about pet Names, IDs, Breeds, and all sorts of other information.
                Along with that, the database also kept track of the employees working at the daycare, including names, positions, addresses, zip codes, phone numbers, emails, hourly rates, and a schedule.
                Below you can see the structure of the table, with the connections between them being the linked values.
