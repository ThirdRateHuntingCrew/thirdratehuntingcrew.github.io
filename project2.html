                <h3>
                    For this project, I placed in a group and tasked with creating a web-based project. For this, we decided on a Discord Bot to assist the user in finding a Job.
                    The responsibility I was given was to create the database behind the bot, while the others in my group worked on the commands and discord integration.
                    The goal of the class was just to make a mock-up of what the actual bot would be, but we took it one step further and got it to respond to commands that would draw from my database, sourcing the jobs off of a scraper working with Linkedin.
